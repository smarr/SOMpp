SOM++ - The Simple Object Machine implemented in C++
====================================================

Introduction
------------

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was also used for teaching.

Currently, implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), Python
(PySOM), RPython (RPySOM), the Truffle framework (TruffleSOM), and
Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple SOM Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains the C++ implementation of SOM, including an
implementation of the SOM standard library and a number of examples. Please see
the [main project page][SOMst] for links to the VM implementations.


SOM++ can be built with Make:

    $ make

Afterwards, the tests can be executed with:

    $ ./SOM++ -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    $ ./SOM++ -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello.som

**Note**: On Linux, the library search path needs to be adapted:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.

The debug version of CSOM can be built using the `debug` target:

    $ make debug

Additional documentation, detailing for instance the object model and how to
implement primitives, is available in the `doc` folder.

Advanced Compilation Settings
-----------------------------

SOM++ supports different garbage collectors, including a basic mark/sweep, and
a generational GC. Furthermore, it implements different variants for integer
handling.


Tagged integers:

    default: off
    option name: TAGGING
    example: make TAGGING=true

Integer caching:

    default: off
    option name: INT_CACHE
    example: make INT_CACHE=true
