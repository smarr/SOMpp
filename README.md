SOM++ - The Simple Object Machine implemented in C++
====================================================

Introduction
------------

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Århus
(Denmark) where it was also used for teaching.

Implementations exist for instance for Java (SOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), Python & RPython
(PySOM), the Truffle framework (TruffleSOM), and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple SOM Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains the C++ implementation of SOM. The implementation of
the SOM standard library and a number of examples are included as a git submodule.
Please see the [main project page][SOMst] for links to other VM implementations.


SOM++ uses CMake and an optimized release build can be built like this:

```bash
mkdir cmake-build && cd cmake-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

Afterwards, the tests can be executed with:

```bash
./SOM++ -cp ../Smalltalk ../TestSuite/TestHarness.som
```

A simple Hello World program is executed with:

```bash
./SOM++ -cp ../Smalltalk ../Examples/Hello.som
```

Additional documentation, detailing for instance the object model and how to
implement primitives, is available in the `doc` folder.


Advanced Compilation Settings
-----------------------------

SOM++ supports different garbage collectors, including a basic mark/sweep, and
a generational GC. Furthermore, it implements different variants for integer
handling.


Tagged integers:

    default: off
    option name: TAGGING
    example: cmake .. -DUSE_TAGGING=true

Integer caching:

    default: off
    option name: INT_CACHE
    example: cmake .. -DCACHE_INTEGER=true


Development Build and Testing
-----------------------------

A build with assertions for development and debugging can be built with:

```bash
mkdir cmake-debug && cd cmake-debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make -j
```

This build also creates a `unittests` binary, which uses cppunit for
implementation-level unit tests, to run the basic interpreter tests
in `TestSuite/BasicInterpreterTests`, as well as the SOM test suite.

The unit tests need the SOM classpath set as follows:

```bash
./unittests -cp ../Smalltalk:../TestSuite/BasicInterpreterTests ../Examples/Hello.som
```

Code Style and Linting
----------------------

To have a somewhat consistent code style and catch some basic bugs, the CI
setup runs `clang-format` and `clang-tidy`

```bash
clang-tidy --config-file=.clang-tidy src/**/*.cpp -- -fdiagnostics-absolute-paths
clang-format --dry-run --style=file --Werror src/*.cpp  src/**/*.cpp src/**/*.h
```
